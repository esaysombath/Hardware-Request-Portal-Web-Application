# Hardware Request Portal Application
 Created a web-based Hardware Request Management System with Flask and SQLite, enabling mechanics to submit hardware requests easily. The system sends automated email notifications to the Kitting clerk for quick retrieval. This project showcases my skills in web development and database management, optimizing hardware inventory management.
